# Credit_Card_Fraud_Analysis

This project uses SQL to spot suspicious patterns in credit card transactions. By analyzing real transaction data, it uncovers things like high-risk merchants, unusual spending behavior, and locations—like New York—that show a spike in fraud. The goal is to better understand how fraud happens and suggest ways to catch it earlier, like real-time tracking or smarter security systems.
